# nanophotonic-simulation
Here we are trying to model & simulate the band structures (tightbinding, FDTD, PWE (plane wave expansion), Density Functional theory (DFT), ...)
1) approximation will be confusing as we use fundamental quantum physics & mathematical approx. so if there is a mistake, let me know!
2) plots would change in your system --> we tried to upload the results, codes and methods!
3) feel free to create your own proper plots.
4) the results are not for paper publications (they would fit for research-paper but we don't use that way), here we try to share our results clearly (free knowledge).
